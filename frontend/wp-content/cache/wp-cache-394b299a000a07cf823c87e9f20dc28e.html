				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Karla Thomas &#8211; Co-Founder of Homeology</p>
<p>Every time I take new clients out to look at communities and homes, especially if they are relocating from out of town, I am able to experience that community through their eyes and needs. Recently, I helped a young couple from NY with 3 kids work through the community selection process.  With help from Homeology, they narrowed their choices to Lincoln Park and Wilmette. After looking at housing in Lincoln Park in the $1.2-1.5 Million bracket and still not finding the space and quality they needed, they decided to give the North Shore a try. For this family, while they craved the larger, more city like and diverse feel of Evanston, they were truly drawn to the A++ schools in Wilmette especially at the high school level. This was a reminder to me of how important the school benchmarking process in at Homeology. I have families that run from the rigor and competitive nature of New Trier while others will settle for nothing less. It truly is a personal decision.</p>
<p>Our clients started their tour of the community by visiting Central Elementary and Mc Kenzie Elementary Schools.  They were impressed with both schools, Mc Kenzie recently having been renovated, and Central with a huge technology program coming in the near future. They decided to limit their search to these schools because of the proximity to the lake and downtown.</p>
<p><a href="http://homeologychicago.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Slide1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3022" src="http://homeologychicago.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Slide1-300x225.jpg" alt="Slide1" width="386" height="289" data-id="3022" /></a></p>
<p>So we all set out to look at houses and here’s what my clients learned along the way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inventory is low! This is not a Wilmette problem, it is true for many of the most sought after suburbs.</li>
<li>For a Budget under $1.8 Million they needed to decide between the following two options :
<ol>
<li>Newer construction west of Green Bay or</li>
<li>Vintage charm (most with updated kitchens and baths) closer to the lake. YOU CAN’T HAVE THEM BOTH!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you live within 8 blocks of the lake, use of the lakefront becomes a lifestyle and not just something you do sporadically. Gillson Park on the lake is a true Gem.</li>
<li>For families of 5 or more, that require the 4 bed / 3 bath second floor  lay out…it’s a tough hunt. While this may sound excessive at first glance, if you have 3 kids who will eventually be teenagers, you want the kids to have two baths to share between 3 teenagers.</li>
<li>New Construction is getting bigger and bigger… and is now too big in their opinion. Developers are trying to get the most out of their 600K land purchase, so they are building gigantic 3 floor, 6 bedrooms plus office, plus workroom, plus playroom Mc Mansions. Even when you can afford it, the space is excessive and hard to manage.</li>
<li>Above all, they loved the feel of Wilmette. People were friendly and willing to talk to a potential new neighbor. Parks were a plenty, the walking downtown and access to the lake, makes Wilmette a unique community that they are excited to settle into this coming summer.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a great experience to see Wilmette through my client’s eyes.  I learned that even with a sizeable budget, families have to understand what is most important to them and make important trade offs, such as giving up city life in favor of space and schools.  I also could see the wonderful things Wilmette has to offer and understand why it is such a highly desired community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding the right place to live is a very personal process. There is a lot of information out there signaling to you what is a great neighborhood. You hear about the hottest neighborhoods (Andersonville was ranked 7<sup>th</sup> in the country by Redfin), the tightest inventory of homes (Cicero has lowest inventory right now), the most rapid increase in prices. But do these news blurbs help in you finding the perfect neighborhood?</p>
<p>My opinion is no. What is “cool”, “hip”, or “hot” to one person is not to another. Logan Square is one of the “hottest” neighborhoods in the city. But at my age, the thought of tons of coffee shops filled with hipsters and edgy millennials is not appealing. Brings to mind this quote from Seinfeld:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that there is anything wrong with that&#8221;</p>
<p>Now a days, I like to walk the dog in the neighborhood and not be run over by traffic, bikes, or people texting on their phone. I still do like to go out, but I’m not looking for what is new and hip. I like good food that is reasonably priced (since now I can cook better than most restaurants, and I can control the quality of the ingredients). I really prefer authentic ethnic restaurants, since I don’t know how to cook those dishes. I really enjoy laid-back bars with great beer selections, or I like going directly to the brewery. The great thing about breweries is that I find the clientele to always be friendly and varied, at least in age.</p>
<p>So I know what is important to me, do you know what is important to you?</p>
<p>You may think that renting is not a long-term commitment. You don’t think there any issue with getting it wrong. I say think about the last time you packed up all your things moved it to a new place, then unpacked when you got there. Then you need to live there for at least a year. Isn’t a year of your life a big deal? Isn’t moving a whole lot of work?</p>
<p>The best way to find the right neighborhood is to visit and spend some time. Make sure you feel at home and there are no conflicts with your needs. Some of you have asked friends about the best place to live. Well, your friends are biased. They want you to live near them because it is convenient for them. It also minimizes their bad choices (remember that misery loves company). Go there yourself and talk to people on the street, in the park, in the bars, in the restaurants. They will give you a more honest perspective than your friends. Try to find people that are like you and talk to them. Also, I have a saying “Live where you play, not where you work”. I’m not sure the source of the saying, but I have followed it much of my life and I stand by it. It is much easier to commute and extra 20 minutes to work everyday then to be far from people that you are most compatible with. Routine transportation can actually be therapeutic. And with mobile phones, tablets, and hot spots, we rarely waste the commute time.</p>
<p>I relate finding the right neighborhood to finding that vacation spot that you always want to return to. You all know that place. Where everything seems easier and more comfortable. That is the same feeling you should experience when you find that right place to live.</p>
<p>At Homeology, our goal is not to replace your assessment of where the right place is for you, but to help you get in the right ballpark. We give you information that allows you to make a decision faster. Then we link you up with real estate experts in the locations you are considering. This is a wining combination &#8211; community matching, neighborhood specialists, and your own sense of being at home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Brittany Fish of <a href="http://apartmentpeople.com/">Apartment People</a></p>
<p>Whether you are a current or soon-to-be resident of a large city much like Chicago, it’s evident that your hunt for an apartment will present you with a challenge to some degree.  An apartment rental agency such as Apartment People has the ability to efficiently match owners to renters by utilizing their knowledge, expertise, and landlord relationships throughout the city. So before diving into the trenches of finding an apartment- why not have an experienced agent do the work for you, cost-free?</p>
<h2><b>Free Service</b></h2>
<p>Free service- It doesn’t get more affordable than that! Apartment People, along with several other apartment rental agencies are a free service for tenants.  Because of the aggressive rental market in a city like Chicago, landlords and property management companies will compensate apartment finding agencies to help them find tenants.<span id="more-143"></span></p>
<h2><b>Number of Listings</b></h2>
<p>Like Apartment People, agencies can have up to thousands of listings available for tenants to choose from. Specifically in Chicago, Apartment People covers as far North as Evanston all the way down to the South Loop, offering a generous amount of available listings at great prices.</p>
<p><a href="http://apartmentpeople.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/blogPic2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-155" src="http://apartmentpeople.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/blogPic2-1024x407.jpg" alt="chicago apartments" width="640" height="254" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Expertise of a Leasing Consultant</b></h2>
<p>Through extensive training, all leasing agents/consultants are licensed by the state. After becoming licensed, they hit the streets every day, all year long, becoming familiar with the rental market, neighborhoods, properties and apartment complexes. Essentially, a leasing agent will know what areas and listings are best for you based on what you are looking for!</p>
<h2><b>Landlord and Property Management Relationships</b></h2>
<p>In many cases, private owners will only list their units through apartment finding services. Since Apartment People has built their relationships with landlord and property management companies for 30 years in the city of Chicago, we may have access to an ample amount of listings that you wouldn’t be able to find online. Also, keys for units are typically held at the agency, allowing greater accessibility to units.</p>
<h2>Reduces Legwork, Saves Time</h2>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-113" src="http://apartmentpeople.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moving-236x300.jpg" alt="chicago apartment" width="154" height="196" />If you are not familiar with the neighborhoods, price ranges, and rental market  of the city you are looking to live in- the chances of continuously spinning your wheels for a new place are pretty high. To make life easier on yourself, let a <a href="http://apartmentpeople.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moving.jpg"><br />
</a>professional utilize their expertise and knowledge to find you your new home that aligns perfectly with your budget and search requirements!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am considering buying a single-family home. My fiancé and I have run out of room in our 2-bedroom condo in East Village. While I love where we live &#8211; access to the Blue Line, minutes from the Loop, tons of wonderful restaurants, bars, and coffee shops (and donut shops to go along). We are straining to find places to put all our stuff. Honestly, one of the biggest issues is taking the dog in and out 3-4 times a day, given that we live on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.</p>
<p>Can any of you relate to this?</p>
<p>Being a co-founder at a community matching service, Homeology, you would think that the thought of looking for a new place to live would be easy. Well, the challenge isn’t in getting community match done, the Homeology process is quite good. The challenge is <strong><u>PREPARING</u></strong> for the community match.</p>
<p>In order to find the right place to live, you first need to be clear on your requirements, needs, and wants. The first consideration is your monthly budget. We are using this tool to help understand the maximum we want to pay in monthly home expenses: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1c1jqfn8s38SjBxeThiU1ZDUmc&amp;authuser=0">Monthly Budget Tool</a></p>
<p>With this tool, the output is a “maximum monthly expense”. It is calculated based on a debt to income ratio. In other words, how much do you owe each month versus how much you earn each month. Lenders use this ratio to approve loans and determine rates. Practice is to keep this ratio below 36%, and the <u>lower the better</u> in improving your chance of getting a loan. If you are renting, you can still use this tool. Landlords also look at your credit before letting you sign up for a lease you can’t afford.</p>
<p>An important question to ask yourself now, is do you <strong><u>WANT</u></strong> to spend 36% of your income on a loan or lease, or do you want to use your money for other things. Think about family vacations, pricey (though fulfilling) hobbies, or saving to retire early. In our case, we are considering all of these things, so we set our ratio to 30% to come up with our housing monthly expense budget.</p>
<p>Next, you should consider your priorities and understand trade-offs. We all want to live in an affordable &#8211; safe neighborhood, which is quiet and green, has plenty of yard space, has lots of local amenities, and is only 30 minutes from work.   That would be a popular place, right?!   The reality is that it is very hard to get everything you want, so you need to identify where you will compromise and where you will not. For me, commute is the big non-negotiable. In my younger years, I spent several hours everyday commuting from Lakeview to Lisle. Never again!</p>
<p>I also must have social and economic diversity. Lastly, I need to be near an area where I can walk and run, and I don’t want to have to drive there. This is so important to my well-being and is something that I must have.</p>
<p>For you, think about what is really important to you and your family. I stress that you need to let go of social pressures. This decision should not about what other people think. It should only be about what makes you happy. Rarely does a house alone make people happy. Visualize yourself walking in your neighborhood &#8211; think about how you want to interact with neighbors and what you want to see.</p>
<p>Write down what is really important to you and share this with the whole family. It is important to discuss what makes everyone happy. Have them add to the list, then vote on the most important factors. Even if you clearly know what is most important to the whole family, it does not mean that you can have everything. So also take the time to weigh the factors. The truth is that nothing is really equal. Work hard to determine the rank of your factors.</p>
<p>You are armed with a budget and your prioritized family requirements, needs, and wants. Now you can start your community search!   And if you need a little help in finding the ideal place to live, please visit <a href="http://www.homeologychicago.com">Homeology</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like me, you spent most of your 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s in the city.  When I looked for a place to live the most important factor was how many blocks to the coffee shop.  I lived in Andersonville for 14 years and I thought it was the perfect mix of city living and small town community.  I chatted with friends as I walked my dog, local shop owners knew most my name, and I had a couple of favorite dinner and drink spot that made me feel like home.  Then came baby #1 and shortly there after Baby #2.</p>
<p>Suddenly, dog walks were shorter and less leisurely, I was lucky if I make it out to dinner once a quarter, and I never visited my favorite Martini Bar again.  But even though I couldn’t truly appreciate all that the city had to offer any more, that little voice inside kept telling me that I am a &#8220;city person&#8221;.  I didn’t know if I could enter the life of a suburbanite.  But when I did a non-emotional pros and cons list that included some very finite and important factors like budget and school performance, moving to the suburbs keeps coming up on top.  So I caved&#8230; and off to the suburbs we went, Evanston to be exact.  A year and a half later, here is what I learned:</p>
<p><b>Location Matters Even More Within the Suburb</b></p>
<p>Even if like my family, you know which suburb you want to go to from the beginning, areas have distinctly different feels.  40% of all the houses in Evanston are within 15 minutes walk to one of the 4 commercial strips (Central, Church, Dempster and Main).  And while a choice like Naperville may feel so far out there and super suburban, you can live in the heart of it&#8217;s downtown and walk to the Metra, grocery, river walk and have a life very similar to an Andersonville or Lakeview&#8230; well&#8230;not as many bars&#8230;but how has time for that anyway.  So we ended up a 12 minute walk from the center of the Church Street Commercial District, and we can still walk to the YMCA, the farmers market, the library and restaurants in the summer.  We even walk to the lake as well.  This helped us maintain much of what we liked about our old Andersonville / Bowmanville location. You can live in pretty pricey areas of Evanston and still must jump in your car for everything.</p>
<p><b>Consider Family Activities and Amenities</b></p>
<p>My kids are presently 4 and 2, the most important aspect of my house location is it&#8217;s proximity to a park.  Evanston is packed full with parks.  We live within a 4 block walk to 4 different parks.  The one across the street has tennis, soccer and baseball fields and basketball in addition to the play ground.  My kids have been to gymnastics, ballet, ice skating, swimming and music at several of the numerous park districts or the YMCA.</p>
<p><b>I had to Give up Some Amenities</b></p>
<p>While downtown Evanston is walkable from my house, it&#8217;s simply not the same as downtown Andersonville.  Evanston&#8217;s commercial offerings are spotty, and I don&#8217;t have the same desire to pop in and out of stores on a lazy sunday afternoon walk as I did in Andersonville.  Maybe it&#8217;s because Andersonville was committed to no big chains, and Evanston is all Gap, Barnes and Nobles and other big names&#8230;but it&#8217;s a big change!  As far as restaurants, in the last 2 years restaurants like Found, Farm House, Smylie Brothers and Boltwood have popped up and become the salvation of date nights for all Evanstonians.  There are tons of family and college friendly places, but on the one night a month that I get to go out on Mommies&#8217; night out, I don&#8217;t want plastic table cloths and pizza. There are also a couple of local breweries popping up that adds to Evanston&#8217;s hopeful transition to a Foodie paradise.</p>
<p><b>Diversity Does Exist in the Suburbs!</b></p>
<p>Diversity was a big factor for our family.  We were looking for racial, socioeconomic, and family structure diversity.  We found this in Evanston.  I joke that a straight white couple in Evanston is almost the minority.  I love when I take my daughters to swimming there are three other adopted families, four other mixed race families, and three other same sex families with every ethnicity possible.  In all the people that we meet, no one has ever even so much as blinked an eyelid when I introduced my family.  Our street is very diverse as well, across all the factors.  I think it probably is fair to say that Evanston is somewhat segregated socio econmoically, but there several pockets that defy that rule, and we are thrilled to have landed right in the middle of one.</p>
<p><b>Happy With Our Suburban Move</b></p>
<p>Overall, I could not be happier with my decision to move to the suburbs.  We had passed on houses that would have been in a &#8220;better&#8221; school district because the area and school it lacked the diversity we sought.  We really had to look at what factors were most important to us and then be true to them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently created a startup company called Homeology. Our focus is to help people find the right place</p>
<p>to live in the Chicago metro area. During the startup process for Homeology we did tons of surveys and</p>
<p>interviews to help optimize our business model. We learned a lot about how people go about buying a</p>
<p>home, and we had a few key findings to share that could help you avoid a disastrous experience for you</p>
<p>and your family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Underestimating the time required</strong></p>
<p>It took our respondents over 6 months to find a home. And this was with a significant amount of</p>
<p>time and effort spent on the home search. The actual hours spent finding a home averaged over</p>
<p>120 hours. So give yourself plenty of time. Consider any deadlines you have in moving. Think</p>
<p>about when your kid needs to start school and the time of year your want to buy/move. We</p>
<p>recommend starting your home search as early as you possibly can. Remember that closing dates</p>
<p>are negotiable. There is generally a low inventory of homes right now, so while you may be able to</p>
<p>sell quickly, but finding the right place may take longer than you think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Focus on the home rather than the community</strong></p>
<p>We found that people spend 60% of their time looking for homes rather than looking for a</p>
<p>community. It is a great feeling to get a house with all the space and features you want, but</p>
<p>remember that you do need to leave the house once and a while. A strong sense of community has</p>
<p>so many benefits to your family. Your family happiness, financial wellbeing, your children’s social</p>
<p>and educational development all depend on where you live. We recommend you spend 80% of your</p>
<p>effort on the community. When you are absolutely sure you have the right fit, the home search is</p>
<p>more focused and time efficient. You will also find it easier to work with realtors when you know</p>
<p>exactly where you want to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Not looking at the full cost of owning a home relative to your budget</strong></p>
<p>We can’t stress this point enough. We have heard from many people that they ended up being</p>
<p>house poor because they did not account for all the costs involved in home ownership. First, make</p>
<p>sure you target a comfortable monthly expense budget for your mortgage. Consider all our current</p>
<p>expenses, college loans, alimony, child support, car payments, etc. Don’t forget about future</p>
<p>expenses that could come up. Is your car old and need replacement in next year or two? Do you</p>
<p>have an aging parent who may need aide? Do you need to pay for education for your children?</p>
<p>Once you have all these expenses considered, look at what is left over from your monthly take home</p>
<p>salary and other income. Now ask, do you want to travel? Does your family enjoy hobbies that cost</p>
<p>significant money? Do you love to entertain? Think about all this when setting your monthly</p>
<p>budget. Once you have a comfortable amount of money you want to spend on home expenses after</p>
<p>all your personal and lifestyle expenses, then you can start to understand a target mortgage</p>
<p>payment. Now you need to consider how much money to put towards a down payment.</p>
<p>Remember that you should be keeping some savings on hand for emergencies. Now you can use a</p>
<p>mortgage calculator to understand your monthly payment considering terms, rates, down payment,</p>
<p>insurance, and taxes. Taxes vary wildly in the Chicago metro area, so be very conservative here.</p>
<p>Zillow has a nice calculator at http://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/</p>
<p>You will be in a much better place if you understand these common mistakes and focus on community</p>
<p>and budget. If you don’t have the time to devote to the home search process, consider reaching out to</p>

You don&#8217;t want the first thing to be violence,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Every time Chicago is in the headlines for violence, the reputation gets a little more tarnished.&#8221; </span><span class="s2"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the same time, the Federal Reserve reported in June 2014 that demand remained strong for skilled workers, particularly for professional and technical occupations and skilled manufacturing and building trades. </span><span class="s2"><sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this leaves recruiters with a significant dilemma when filling Chicago based job openings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do I convince candidates to accept a Chicago based job?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One way is to have your candidate work with Homeology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Founder Karla Thomas says “Homeology is doing something no one else is doing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We deeply understand our client’s home and lifestyle desires.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We then use our proprietary logic to match the client to the best community to maximize their family’s happiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We understand family dynamics when it comes to relocation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a lot of apprehension within the whole family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the candidate and their spouse can visualize where they may live, we are able to turn their apprehension into excitement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The candidate will more likely accept the position when they have the prospect of both a great new job and a happy family.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We at Homeology see great potential in working with recruiters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can work with a candidate in the early stages of a job consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can demonstrate the livability and character of wonderful Chicago area towns and neighborhoods, and take them from negative perceptions to thinking about making a home in Chicago. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
